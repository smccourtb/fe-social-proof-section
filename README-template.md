## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox
-   CSS
-   Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I had a tough time with the paragraph text. Not sure how to fix it. I feel that it is hard to figure out font-size based on images alone. I would have a muc heasier time replicating if at least given the correct font sizes and then I can correct things with padding and such.
